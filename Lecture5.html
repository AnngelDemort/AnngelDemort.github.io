            <p class="lead"> Monkey once said, "When caught up in an unseemly situation, we usually look for the easy way out. And unfortunately, procrastination is the natural response. This quote serves us with a reminder that perhaps the best route is going “through” the problem, rather than around it. As a result, you find that good things begin to happen when you cease to delay and beat about the bush and take matters into your hand to resolve it."</p>
