      <p>The Death of Harambe</p>
      <p>On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to use lethal force. A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals near humans and the need for better standards of care.</p>

      <h5>She is truly Le Monke</h5>

      <p>Le Monke: The Opposite of Harambe</p>
      <p>Le Monke is a chaotic and evil being. A cursed, disturbing YouTube video titled "UH OH" has surfaced in which Monke goes on a rant centered on feces. She is best known for committing multiple counts of tax evasion and vehicular manslaughter. It has recently surfaced that she has committed various war crimes in eastern Kyrgyzstan, but that is yet to be verified. The monkey has the ability to trash your house and vore you and your family. She can run at an astonishing speed of over 90 mph, and the U.S. government has enlisted her as a successful bounty hunter. As a bounty hunter she has caught many ISIS leaders, fighters, and affiliates. For every catch she is rewarded with poop. Not so surprisingly, her favorite food is tacos with poop.Not much else is known about Monke other than that she loves poop with a deep passion and finds the stinky variety extremely amusing. She is also very successful in the commercial plumbing industry. She has won several medals for her achievements in stand up comedy, plumbing and warfare, although they have since been stripped of her due to the war crime rumours. Another ability le Monke is rumoured to have is to freeze time. This ability comes in useful when she is hunting down ISIS war criminals. But without her payment of the freshest poop, she wouldnâ€˜t do any of this. She works for the highest bidder. </p>
